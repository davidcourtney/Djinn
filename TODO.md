## Enhancements

- warning when a declaration shadows a function name
- utf-8 identifiers
  - using AntlrInputStream, charVocabulary grammar option, '\u00c0' .. '\uFEFC' | <ascii range>
- track sealed methods in method builder and seal at the end of a translation unit
- mapping of type declaration literals to builtin types ("bool" -> BooleanAtom)
- move the primitive factory code entirely inside the runtime class, expose only a getPrimitive method
- upgrade jline to standalone version (not scala version)
- gather additional features from dylan, cat, factor, joy, clojure, plot
- model
  - add inputs and outputs to action class
  - symbols as messages?
  - tags should be implemented as properties in the metamodel
- primitives
  - roll up, down
  - full numeric intrinsics primitive impls
- prelude
  - additional predicates: odd?, even?, etc
- repl
  - file loading
  - fatal error in parsing should not leave partial definitions, all or nothing
  - restarts, fix and continue
  - refactor commands into separate classes
- types
  - type declaration parser support for type variable qualifiers (partially implemented)
  - representing type variables in the model and metamodel
- syntax
  - more syntax tests for tags, etc
  - exceptions?
  - escape sequences in strings
